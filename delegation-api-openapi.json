Delegations contain the information necessary for Reverse DNS, including the associated nameservers, and DNS Delegation Signer (DS Record) information. Delegations may not be created or deleted independently. They appear and disappear automatically alongside their associated networks. Unlike the other objects, delegations are not given a handle. They are searched for within Whois using a delegation name, like 0.192.in-addr.arpa.",
